The goal is each time to end up with code that makes use of modern constructs, and is easier to understand.\nOld loop constructs It is obvious that we want very old constructs out of the way:\nEnumeration\u0026lt;E\u0026gt; enumeration = vector.elements(); while (enumeration.hasMoreElements()) {  E e = enumeration.nextElement();  accept(e); } is much more verbose than\nvector.forEach(accept); Some coders may even have written\nfor (Enumeration\u0026lt;E\u0026gt; e = v.elements(); e.hasMoreElements();)  accept(e.nextElement()); which does take me a second to parse.\nI am more accustomed to iterators and lists, rather than enumerations and vectors,\nIterator\u0026lt;E\u0026gt; it = list.iterator(); while(it.hasNext()) {  E e = it.next();  accept(e); } but obviously\nlist.forEach(accept) remains the easiest to understand.\nThese examples were focused on conciseness of code: the most compact one is also the one requiring the least mental efforts to understand. But sometimes the loop may hide a real problem:\nfor(int i=0; i\u0026lt;=vector.size(); i++) {  accept(vector.get(i)); } Oops, that = should not have been there. While\nfor(int i=0; i\u0026lt;vector.size(); i++) {  accept(vector.get(i)); } is not such a performance hit, the same construct using a generic List instance may be slow when the underlying implementation is a LinkedList:\nfor(int i=0; i\u0026lt;list.size(); i++) {  accept(list.get(i)); } Conditional return Sometimes, it is simply a matter of aesthetics:\nif(i \u0026lt; 3) {  return -1; } return 1; or\nif(i \u0026lt; 3) {  return -1; } else {  return 1; } or\nreturn i \u0026lt; 3 ? -1 : 1 But what if a method call is involved? Is\nboolean b = someMethod(); if(c) {  return true; } return b; equivalent to\nif(c) {  return true; } return someMethod(); or even\nreturn c || someMethod() This is where e2immu comes into play: it all depends on whether the method is modifying or not. If someMethod modifies the state of this, then it must be called before returning, and\nreturn someMethod() || c; will be correct. If it is not modifying, but, on the contrary, a time-consuming operation, it\u0026rsquo;d be silly not to swap the || clauses, to conditionally avoid a lengthy call.\nFinal fields In this rather trivial example, I\u0026rsquo;d prefer to see a final modifier to count:\npublic class Count {   private int count;   public Count(int input) {  this.count = input;  }   public int getCount() {  return count;  } } It\u0026rsquo;d be easier to use\npublic record Count(int count) {} but then you\u0026rsquo;ll have to swap out getCount() for count() everywhere in your code. A small modification brings me back from modernization to regularization:\npublic class Count {   private int count;   public Count(int input) {  if(input == -1) {  this.count = someComputation(input);  } else {  this.count = input;  }  this.count = this.count + 1; // let\u0026#39;s start counting from 1  }   public int getCount() {  return count;  } } This constructor doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow the final modifier, because count is assigned to more than once. After a regularization step not unlike the one discussed in a previous section, we\u0026rsquo;re back to a single assignment:\npublic class Count {   private final int count;   public Count(int input) {  this.count = (input == -1 ? someComputation(input) : input) + 1;  }   public int getCount() {  return count;  } } I cannot stress enough the importance of being able to see that count will not change during the lifetime of the object.\n","date":"January 1, 1","image":"https://www.codemodernizer.com/images/avatar/04_huf7c885c011a0539925ac6646a2835265_26168_650x0_resize_q100_box.jpg","permalink":"/resources/manual/","title":"Manual"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","date":"January 1, 1","image":"https://www.codemodernizer.com/images/avatar/04_huf7c885c011a0539925ac6646a2835265_26168_650x0_resize_q100_box.jpg","permalink":"/team/","title":"Our Team"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","date":"January 1, 1","image":"https://www.codemodernizer.com/images/avatar/04_huf7c885c011a0539925ac6646a2835265_26168_650x0_resize_q100_box.jpg","permalink":"/pricing/","title":"Pricing"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Responsibility of Contributors Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

However, the model of building systems that only last a couple of years, and that then have to be redesigned, rewritten and replaced, is far from sustainable and efficient.\nEven though the (Java) programming world is constantly evolving and changing, this should not mean the code has to lose value and become outdated. Older code generally has fewer bugs and a lot of domain knowledge has been incorporated over time. Replacing it with new code just because the existing code is becoming \u0026lsquo;old\u0026rsquo; is inefficient, wasteful of time and resources, and almost always more expensive.\nAs the programming language evolves over time, so do the programmers. Younger and newly trained programmers might not easily recognize old software patterns, and also don\u0026rsquo;t feel motivated to try to figure out code that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been updated for decades. We propose to evolve the code with the language and the programmers, so that it does not have to be replaced. Rather, it can last decades by repeatedly modernizing it. At the same time, these modernization transformations are instructive: programmers can also learn from the changes CodeModernizer proposes.\n Our vision is to help standardize and transform code so that it can last for decades, and to educate both beginning and experienced programmers.\n Sustainability Through Software What do we mean with sustainability through software? Creating software that survives trends and retains its value. Sustainable software, at the same time, also concerns the use of resources. Not having to manually re-write code not only saves human resources, but also saves energy. Using existing code offers other advantages, like the fact that the finer details of the code are conserved, which in turn saves even more time and resources.\nAnother way in which we can make code more efficient, and longer lasting, is by making it more compact and readable. A good code base should last through multiple, different generations of programmers at a company. If the code is kept compact, readable, and up-to-date, lots of time and precious resources can be preserved when new coders have to take over the work of the existing ones.\nEducation, Open Source, and Sharing of Knowledge Education is one of the core values of CodeModernizer. The use of our tools is not only beneficial for the source code as an asset, but also for the developers themselves. The world of Java programming is ever evolving and changing, and it is impossible for every developer to keep up with every new trend, library, feature, etc. Programmers who use CodeModernizer are able to see ways in which their code can be improved upon, which also helps them to keep evolving and learning as software engineers.\nAt the same time we also want to give back to the open source community that has been the backbone of the programming world for years. The amount of software projects that have been realized with the help of open source software is countless, and the world wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the same without them.\nWe want as much people using the software as possible, even if they do not necessarily have the funds to do so. That\u0026rsquo;s why we will offer our software for free to students, people employed at educational institutions, and software developers actively working on an open source project.\nSupport for Open Source Our support for open source goes even further: CodeModernizer is based on the e2immu.org project, an open source static code analyzer that focuses on modification and immutability. If you want to get your hands dirty yourself, why not try using e2immu? Even better, you may be able to contribute to the project itself.\n","date":"January 1, 1","image":"https://www.codemodernizer.com/images/avatar/04_huf7c885c011a0539925ac6646a2835265_26168_650x0_resize_q100_box.jpg","permalink":"/values/","title":"Values"}]
