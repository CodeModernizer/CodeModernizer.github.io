Individuals or companies opting for this option will have a guarantee that IBTECH will never get the chance to see the code that CodeModernizer analyzes since the code transformer and standard transformation library can be run locally inside of your own organization, using our binary. The binary writes to a different branch of the source code management system, and we guarantee that the binary does not communicate over the internet, so your code is as secure as it can be.

However, the model of building systems that only last a couple of years, and that then have to be redesigned, rewritten and replaced, is far from sustainable and efficient.\nEven though the (Java) programming world is constantly evolving and changing, this should not mean the code has to lose value and become outdated. Older code generally has fewer bugs and a lot of domain knowledge has been incorporated over time. Replacing it with new code just because the existing code is becoming \u0026lsquo;old\u0026rsquo; is inefficient, wasteful of time and resources, and almost always more expensive.\nAs the programming language evolves over time, so do the programmers. Younger and newly trained programmers might not easily recognize old software patterns, and also don\u0026rsquo;t feel motivated to try to figure out code that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been updated for decades. We propose to evolve the code with the language and the programmers, so that it does not have to be replaced. Rather, it can last decades by repeatedly modernizing it. At the same time, these modernization transformations are instructive: programmers can also learn from the changes CodeModernizer proposes.\n Our vision is to help standardize and transform code so that it can last for decades, and to educate both beginning and experienced programmers.\n Sustainability Through Software What do we mean with sustainability through software? Creating software that survives trends and retains its value. Sustainable software, at the same time, also concerns the use of resources. Not having to manually re-write code not only saves human resources, but also saves energy. Using existing code offers other advantages, like the fact that the finer details of the code are conserved, which in turn saves even more time and resources.\nAnother way in which we can make code more efficient, and longer lasting, is by making it more compact and readable. A good code base should last through multiple, different generations of programmers at a company. If the code is kept compact, readable, and up-to-date, lots of time and precious resources can be preserved when new coders have to take over the work of the existing ones.\nEducation, Open Source, and Sharing of Knowledge Education is one of the core values of CodeModernizer. The use of our tools is not only beneficial for the source code as an asset, but also for the developers themselves. The world of Java programming is ever evolving and changing, and it is impossible for every developer to keep up with every new trend, library, feature, etc. Programmers who use CodeModernizer are able to see ways in which their code can be improved upon, which also helps them to keep evolving and learning as software engineers.\nAt the same time we also want to give back to the open source community that has been the backbone of the programming world for years. The amount of software projects that have been realized with the help of open source software is countless, and the world wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the same without them.\nWe want as much people using the software as possible, even if they do not necessarily have the funds to do so. That\u0026rsquo;s why we will offer our software for free to students, people employed at educational institutions, and software developers actively working on an open source project.\nSupport for Open Source Our support for open source goes even further: CodeModernizer is based on the e2immu.org project, an open source static code analyzer that focuses on modification and immutability. If you want to get your hands dirty yourself, why not try using e2immu? Even better, you may be able to contribute to the project itself.\n","date":"January 1, 1","image":"https://demo.gethugothemes.com/CodeModernizer/images/avatar/04_huf7c885c011a0539925ac6646a2835265_26168_650x0_resize_q100_box.jpg","permalink":"/CodeModernizer/values/","title":"Values"}]
